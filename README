for lsl: conda install -c conda-forge liblsl  and then  pip install pylsl

To do:
- when you have openbci running, do this test: connect a speaker and run the auditory tasks while that speaker sits atop an eeg electrode, hopefully shaking it a bit
- remember to standardize: pre-lab subject conditions and intake, also volume of headphones, etc
- implement the auto end of all the auditory stuff
- test sseps for real
- test oddball for real
- push live tci testing to limits
- make plan for live tci walkup and ensure it works
- connect openbci cyton via lsl
- connect grip switch and display it
- wire ssep stimulus into cyton aux port
